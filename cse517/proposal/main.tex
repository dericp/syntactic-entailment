\section{Introduction}

We propose improving natural language inference models by incorporating
syntactic or contextual features into existing models. At its time of
publication, the well-known decomposable attention neural network by
\citet{parikh2016decomposable} obtained state of the art results on the
SNLI dataset (Bowman et al.
2015) while using drastically fewer parameters than previous NLI models. We
want to extend this model and evaluate it on SNLI (Bowman et al. 2015), SNLI
hard (Gururangan et al. 2018), MultiNLI (Williams et al. 2017), MultiNLI hard
(Gururangan et al. 2018), and possibly even domain specific datasets like
Scitail (Khot et al. 2018).
